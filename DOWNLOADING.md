# Downloading Coy

For convenience, we generate binaries as part of our automated build
environment in the following URL:

`https://dl.bintray.com/twstrike/coyim/master`

All binaries are signed using Bintray's GPG key:

```
pub 4096R/D401AB61 2015-02-17
uid Bintray (by JFrog) <bintray@bintray.com>
sub 4096R/DBE1D0A2 2015-02-17
```

Keep in mind this is an automated service provided by Bintray. For any
sensitive use cases you should considering building coy by yourself.

You can find the release history on our Bintray page:
